Certainly, here's the code with all words in English, and the description in English as well:

# Simple Python Code

# Ask the user to input their name
user_name = input("Enter your name: ")

# Display a welcome message
print(f"Hello, {user_name}! Welcome to the world of programming.")


This code prompts the user to enter their name and then prints a welcome message using the entered name.
